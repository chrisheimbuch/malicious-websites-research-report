**ï»¿Malicious & Benign Websites - Machine Learning Research Report**

This is my Phase 3 project during my time at Flatiron School. It focuses on a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and inferential analysis using Python to examine a dataset of websites labeled as benign or malicious. The dataset includes various features such as DNS, TCP, and IP packets captured from a honeypot that interacted with multiple servers worldwide to collect data.

In the first notebook, I performed the EDA, which can be found in Notebook #1. The second notebook delves into a comprehensive machine learning classification analysis where I trained models to predict whether a website is malicious or benign. The final model achieved a 98.4% accuracy.

This project demonstrates a practical, real-world application that can be deployed by individuals or organizations to safeguard against the ever-evolving threat of malicious web activity, such as spyware, malware, ransomware, and more.
